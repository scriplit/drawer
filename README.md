React (using hooks), react-router and material-ui drawer wired together to create a material app with top-level sections (views) presented in a drawer menu. Simply edit `App.js` and put your views in `Components/Views`

You will need [node](https://nodejs.org).
Then run:
```
 npm install yarn -g
 cd drawer
 yarn install
 yarn start
```
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
